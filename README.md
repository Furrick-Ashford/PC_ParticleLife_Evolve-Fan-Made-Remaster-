# PC_ParticleLife_Evolve-Fan-Made-Remaster-
An evolutionary version of Particle Life invented by Jeffrey Ventrella. The original version of this evolutionary simulation was made by Terence Soule of Programming Chaos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2rO9hEjJkjqzktvtj0ggNQ I am a fan who decided to improve it, Terence made the original version by himself.
